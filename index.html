    Main chalkboard wall menu, from the time where the shredded pork meat was the theme. 
    The drawing of a pear had been 
    somewhat vandalized, which is very sad (photo from November 26th, 2024).

    This is the oldest photo from the Da Grasso's series, and it features my very first 
    drawings made for the restaurant -- out of those, the green eye was the 
    one I started with! =) (photo from September 21st, 2023).
